# ML-Random-Forest-Algo
This repo contains codes for Random Forest Algorithm in machine learning


### Random Forest Algorithm in Machine learning  
* It is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems.  
* It builds decision trees on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification and average in case of regression.  
*  It uses bagging and feature randomness when building each individual tree to try to create an uncorrelated forest of trees whose prediction by committee is more accurate than that of any individual tree.  
* Here in the code file we have worked on dataset : load_digits, imported from Scikit-learn library.
